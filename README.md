This repository is intented to be used not only as a personal tracker of the machines from Hack The Box that I manage to get access to, but also as a tool for anyone that needs a some help solving a machine. 

_I'm just getting started into cybersecurity so at the moment I'm only going to be working on machines marked as easy on HTB._
